# Troubleshooting Guide

Dear Learner,

due to dependecies or product updates, you could potentially run into some issues from time to time.

Before posting a question in our [SAP Learning Group](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-learning-groups/ct-p/SAP-Learning), please **read** this troubleshooting guide **carefully**.

First and foremost, make sure to check your cds version:

```bash
cds -v
```

It should print something similair like this:
```bash
...
@sap/cds: 7.2.0
@sap/cds-dk: 7.6.0
...
```

If your ```@sap/cds``` dependency is lower than 7.0.0, then please make sure to upgrade your cds packages:

```bash
npm i @sap/cds-dk@7.6.0 && npm i @sap/cds@7.2.0 && npm update
```

Verify your cds version again with ```cds -v```.

## Issue: BusinessPartner search help on object page not working due to odata count=true

If your business partner search help is not working on the object page, then this is due to an issue with an OData parameter in the query.

### Solution:

In `risk-service.js` adjust the event handler as follows:

```js
 this.on("READ", BusinessPartners, async (req) => {
        // The API Sandbox returns alot of business partners with empty names.
        // We don't want them in our application
        req.query.where("LastName <> '' and FirstName <> '' ");
        
        // --> ADD THIS LINE TO REMOVE THE COUNT PARAMETER
        req.query.SELECT.count = false;

        return await BPsrv.transaction(req).send({
            query: req.query,
            headers: {
                apikey: process.env.apikey,
            },
        });
    });
```

## Issue: NPM can't finde a package / npm package not in registry

```

```

## Solution:

In your `mta.yaml` file, add the `npm ci` command to your `before-all` commands. It should look like the following:

```
_schema-version: '3.1'
ID: risk-management
version: 3.0.0
description: "Template for the Learning Journey Building side-by-side extensions on SAP BTP"
parameters:
  enable-parallel-deployments: true
build-parameters:
  before-all:
    - builder: custom
      commands:
        - npm ci
        - npx cds build --production
modules:
[...]
```
